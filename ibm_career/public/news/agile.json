      "summary": "Let's talk about the popular Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$144 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$116. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Agilent Technologies' current trading price of US$118 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let's take a look at Agilent Technologies's outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.",
