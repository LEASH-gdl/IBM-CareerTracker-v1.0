We used Glimpse to survey more than 100 web developers to learn if and how they leverage AI. According to the survey, that's how many people are still coding from scratch - yet there's no denying that Artificial Intelligence (AI) can speed up the process.\n\nIncorporating AI is like going on an adventure with your phone as a GPS guiding you on what road to take - somebody else has already mapped out the best way for you to get there faster— even skipping distractions and detours along the way, sticking strictly to what works.",

      "summary": "The internet has evolved from a simple network of computers to a complex web of information and services. However, the current version of the web, known as Web 2.0, has some major drawbacks. It is dominated by a few large technology companies that control most of the data, content and platforms that we use online. It also exposes us to various risks such as privacy breaches, censorship, manipulation and misinformation.\nBut what if there was a better way to build and use the web? A way that would empower users, protect their rights and interests, and foster innovation and creativity? A way that would leverage the best of both worlds: decentralization and intelligence?\nThis is the vision of Web3, a term that describes a future version of the Internet in which power and benefits are more equitably shared by the virtue of decentralization.",
